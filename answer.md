Q1. Role of Frontend (FE) The frontend is the "client-side" of a web application. It includes everything the user sees and interacts with. User Interface (UI): This is the visual layout. It uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling (colors, fonts, spacing), and ensures the site works well across different devices. User Interaction: The frontend uses JavaScript to handle user actions like button clicks, form submissions, and animations. This makes the experience dynamic and engaging. Communication with Backend: The frontend serves as a bridge. It collects data from the user and sends it to the server (backend) through APIs. Then, it displays the server’s response back to the user. 

Q2. Role of Backend (BE) The backend is the "server-side," the hidden engine that powers application logic and data management. Server-side Processing: It handles complex calculations and logic that should not occur on the user's device. It receives requests from the frontend and decides what action to take. Database Handling: The backend communicates with databases to create, read, update, or delete information, such as user profiles or product listings. Security and Authentication: It ensures that only authorized users can access certain data. It manages login sessions, password hashing, and protects the app from malicious attacks. 

Q3. Business Logic Business logic is the set of custom rules that dictate how data is created, stored, and changed to meet specific business goals. It defines "how the business works" in code. Real-world Examples: - E-commerce: A rule that states if a user spends over $50, a 10% discount is automatically applied to the total. - Banking: A rule that prevents a user from withdrawing money if their current balance is lower than the requested amount. - Social Media: A rule that only allows "Friends" or "Followers" to view a private profile's photos. 

Q4. Client-Server Model This is the basic framework of the internet where two computers communicate with each other. The Client: Usually a web browser (like Chrome) or a mobile app. It is the party that requests services or resources. The Server: A powerful computer that provides data. It waits for requests, processes them, and responds with the requested information. Communication: This occurs through HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). The client sends a request (e.g., "Give me the homepage"), and the server sends back a response (e.g., the HTML file for that page). 

Q5. Three-Tier Architecture This architecture organizes an application into three logical layers to make it easier to manage and scale. Presentation Layer: The top level (Frontend). This is the user interface. Application (Business) Layer: The middle tier (Backend). This is where business logic and data processing occur. Data Layer: The bottom tier. This includes the database or file system where information is permanently stored. Why is it used? It improves scalability (you can upgrade one layer without breaking others), security (the data layer is hidden from the user), and maintainability (developers can work on the frontend and backend separately). Q6. JavaScript as a Backend Language Originally created for browsers, JavaScript can now run on servers thanks to environments like Node.js. Performance: JavaScript uses an "Event-driven, non-blocking I/O" model. This makes it extremely fast and efficient for handling many simultaneous connections, such as in a chat app. Ecosystem: It has the largest package registry in the world (NPM), giving developers access to millions of pre-written code libraries to speed up development. Popular Backend Frameworks: - Express.js: The most popular, minimalist framework for building APIs. - NestJS: A structured, powerful framework for large-scale applications. - Fastify: Focused on providing the highest performance and lowest overhead.
